## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). During development, the `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output.

```shell
npm start # or `yarn start`
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Preview

The preview command will create a production build of the client modules, a production build of `src/entry.preview.tsx`, and run a local server. The preview server is only for convenience to locally preview a production build, and it should not be used as a production server.

```shell
npm run preview # or `yarn preview`
```

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. Additionally, the build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
npm run build # or `yarn build`
```

### Marking string for translation

Any string can be marked for translation by using the `$localize` template function like so:

```typescript
export default component$((props: { name: string }) => {
	return <span>{$localize`Hello ${props.name}!`}</span>;
});
```

### Extracting string for translation

The first step in translation is to build the application. Once the artifacts are build the strings can be extracted for translation.

```bash
npm run build.client
npm run i18n-extract
```

The result of the commands is `src/locale/message.en.json`.

### Translating strings

Take the resulting string and send them for translation. Produce a file for each language. For example:

```bash
src/locale/message.en.json    # Original strings
src/locale/message.es.json
```

### Sorting translations

Qwik hashes bundles based on the content of the files. This means that if a file changes, the order of i18n translations will be lost and can be difficult to manage manually.

```bash
npm run i18n-sort
```

The `i18n-sort` script will sort by first appearance in the src folder to keep a consistent order.

### Testing translations

The resulting language should match your browser language. You can also override the language by adding ?lang=es to the URL.
